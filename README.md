# Azure Container Apps Workshop – Lab

This repo contains a **GitHub‑hosted** lab to containerize a web API, deploy to **Azure Container Apps (ACA)** with ACR, Managed Identity, Key Vault, autoscale, and blue/green revisions. It supports two AI options: **Azure OpenAI** (managed) or **Ollama** (local model sidecar).

See `.github/workflows/` for CI/CD and `bicep/` for IaC.
